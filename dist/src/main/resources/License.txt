1.     Terms of Use

The following are terms of a legal agreement between you and ShareTheGoodOnes Technologies Inc. on its behalf and on behalf of its subsidiaries ("ShareTheGoodOnes") for the use of this website (and all sub-domains) (hereinafter referred to as “Website”).

This Website is owned and operated by ShareTheGoodOnes and may be used by you only for personal, non-commercial purposes. You are not authorized to change, adapt, rearrange, reformulate or decrypt the content of this Website, in any way whatsoever.

By accessing, browsing and/or using this Website, you acknowledge that you have read and understood and that you agree to abide by and comply with all terms, conditions and notices contained in or referenced by these Terms of Use (“TOU”) without limitation or qualification. Your use of this website is subject to the TOU and all applicable laws. If you are accessing, browsing and /or using this Website on behalf of your employer or any other person, you represent that you are authorized to accept these TOU on your employer’s or the other person’s behalf. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE OR CANNOT AGREE TO THESE TOU, PLEASE IMMEDIATELY CEASE USING THIS WEBSITE. YOUR USE OF THIS WEBSITE CONSTITUTES IRREFUTABLE EVIDENCE OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TOU. ShareTheGoodOnes reserves the right, in its discretion, to update or revise these TOU and to post such updated or revised TOU on this Website. PLEASE CHECK THE TOU PERIODICALLY FOR CHANGES AND UPDATES. CHANGES OR UPDATES TO THIS WEBSITE MAY OCCUR WITHOUT NOTICE. YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THIS WEBSITE FOLLOWING THE POSTING OF ANY CHANGES TO THE TOU CONSTITUTES IRREFUTABLE EVIDENCE OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THOSE CHANGES. Other third party websites (including those that we link to) may have their own terms and conditions of use and policies, which we do not control, and thus are not addressed by these TOU.
2.     Privacy Policy

From time to time, you may be requested to provide ShareTheGoodOnes with personal information. Such personal information is subject to ShareTheGoodOnes's Privacy Policy. Please review ShareTheGoodOnes's Privacy Policy posted on this Website. This Privacy Policy is important information and also governs your use of this Website.
3.     Forward-Looking Statements and Information

This Website includes forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include all statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts, and you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as "believes," "expects," "may," "will," "should," "seeks," "approximately," "intends," "plans," "estimates," "projects", “foresees”, “continues” or "anticipates" or the negative of these terms or variations thereon or similar terminology. By their nature, forward-looking statements require ShareTheGoodOnes to make assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may change at any time, and, therefore, may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected. YOU ARE CAUTIONED NOT TO PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS OR FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION. While ShareTheGoodOnes believes that its assumptions are reasonable and appropriate based on the information available, it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and, of course, it is impossible to anticipate all factors that could affect ShareTheGoodOnes's actual results. Readers are referred to the section on Risks and uncertainties contained in ShareTheGoodOnes filings (including without limitation ShareTheGoodOnes’s Annual Information Form and the Management’s Discussion and Analysis in ShareTheGoodOnes’s Annual Report). ShareTheGoodOnes expressly disclaims any intention, and assumes no obligation, to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
